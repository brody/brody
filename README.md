## G'day, I’m Brody MacLean ✌️ 

I’m a multi-disciplinary product designer based in [Sydney, Australia](https://time.is/Sydney). Currently, I’m a Design System Lead at [Prospa](https://www.prospa.com/) giving our designers and developers the tools to help small businesses keep moving. Previously I've made things at places like [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com/), [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/) and [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/).

### Vision

I want to work on meaningful and valuable products that do good, for man, nature and the planet. I want to dedicate my skills, experience and knowledge to projects and people who want to _make this world a better place_.
